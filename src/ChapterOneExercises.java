/*Exercise 1
-In computer jargon the difference between a statement and a comment is as follows:  
  	A statement is part of a program that specifies one step of an algorithm 
  	and a comment is a part of a program that contains information about the program but
  	 has no effect when the program runs. 
-When a program is portable it is said to be able to run 
	on more than one kind of computer.
-In common english the word “compile” means to take a program from
 	an “easy to understand” programming language to an “easy to run” programming language
  	so that it can be used at a later time.
-An “executable” is a term defined as: Another name for object code that is ready
 	to run on specific hardware.”  It is a noun because it refers to an object which is ready to be
 	 “executed” or ready to perform a task.
